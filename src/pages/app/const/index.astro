          <p>
            Constrained writing is a literary technique that involves writing a
            text that is subject to a set of rules or constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            These constraints can be anything from the number of words in a text
            to the use of specific words or letters. The goal of constrained
            writing is to create a text that is both creative and challenging to
            write.
          </p>
          <p>
            For ESL students, constrained writing can be a great way to practice
            their language skills while also having fun.
