<Layout>
  <main class="container mx-auto h-[100dvh] pt-16">
    <section class="prose max-w-3xl px-8 py-32">
      <h1>Hi</h1>
      <p>the page you're looking at is made to fix my rewriting bugs</p>
      <p></p>
      basically vercel (for astro) decided not to care about the rewritten urls if
      it was not found in the first place. so it doesn't go into the middleware and
      doesn't get rewritten. so i just made sure that every page is there (here)
      and it works now.

      <p>
        we might get a change to make {comma} in the future so stay tuned!
