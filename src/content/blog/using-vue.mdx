import Wrapper1 from "@/components/blog/using-vue/Wrapper1.astro";

```astro

// Wrapper.astro

<Layout>
  <WordBar client:visible />
  <!-- How do you handle global states between these two components -->
  <CodeEditor client:visible />
</Layout>
```

## Introduction

In the making of [CONST!](https://const.qttn.dev), one of the challenges
I faced was checking if the paragraph contains the mandated vocabulary, and
display the progress of the game.

1. `WordBar` needs to display the set of words and these can be swapped out to get a new word.
2. `CodeEditor` should know the word list and notify `WordBar` if a word is found in the paragraph.

For Vue, we have different ways to achieve this.

- Use a parent component to manage the state and pass it down to the children.
  (We would lose the benefits of Astro islands and have to manage props and emits)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) but it's a bit overkill for this use case.
- [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) which is what recommended by [Astro themselves](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/).
  It is very lightweight but its API is not as convenient for my use case when I want to modify an array.

## Using Vue outside of Vue components

I have been working with Vue 3 since 2020, but I never knew we can already create `ref` and other reactive objects outside of Vue components.

Yes, we can.
You can export it from one file and import it in another Vue component.

```ts
export const words = ref([]);
```

This means you can do this in one file:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { words } from "@/store/words"; // Import from another file // [!code highlight]
</script>

<template>
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(word, idx) in words"
      :key="word.id"
      :class="{ 'badge-primary': word.match }"
      @click="swapOutWord(idx)"
    >
      {{ word.name }}
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>
```

and do this in another:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { words } from "@/store/words"; // Import from another file // [!code highlight]

const code = ref("I ate a cake, and a banana ate me.");
const matchedAll = computed(
  () =>
    wordStore.value.length > 0 && wordStore.value.every((word) => word.match),
);
watch(
  () => code.value,
  () => {
    wordStore.value = wordStore.value.map((word) => ({
      ...word,
      match: code.value.includes(word.name),
    }));
  },
  {
    immediate: true,
  },
);
</script>

<template>
  <textarea
    :class="{
      'bg-green-200': matchedAll,
    }"
    v-model="code"
  ></textarea>
</template>
```

## But hey, how do you initialize the ref with prefetched data?

If you insert as a prop and the initialize it with `onMounted`,
there is a chance that `CodeEditor` will be rendered before the `words` is
properly initialized. Moreover, to ensure the race condition of `CodeEditor`'s
`watch`, `WordBar` needs to be rendered first.

First, I made `WordBar` render first by setting it as `client:load`
and everything else as `client:visible`.

```astro /client:load data={data}/
---
const data = [
  /* ... */
];
---

<Layout>
  <WordBar client:load data={data} />
  <CodeEditor client:visible />
</Layout>
```

Next, what I did was slightly illegal but essentially,
I just set the value of the ref directly without any hooks.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
import { words } from "@/store/words";

const $props = defineProps<{
  data: string[];
}>();

words.value = $props.data.map((name) => ({ name, match: false }));
</script>
```

And that's it! Now, try changing the code, swapping out the words, and see the magic happen.

## What about other frameworks?

1. React: `useState` must only be called in a component.
2. Svelte: While you can create `writable` stores outside of components, it is not 
   usable anywhere else other than Svelte components.
3. Angular: I have no idea.
4. Qwik: `useSignal` must only be called in `$component` but this is understandable
   because Qwik doesn't "hydrate"
5. Solid: Yes! You absolutely can!

```tsx
import { setTest, test } from "./hooks";

export function SolidComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <p>{test()}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

import { SolidComponent } from "@/components/blog/using-vue/Solid.tsx";

<SolidComponent client:visible />

However, I'm not a fan of having to import both get and set functions in the same file.
It might be convenient to do that in Solid, and it also imposes a rule to not accidentally
mutate the state directly.

And I can also do that in Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { testVue, increment } from "./hooks";
</script>

<template>
  <div class="flex items-center justify-center gap-4">
    <button class="btn" @click="increment" }>Increment</button>
    <p class="grid h-12 w-12 place-content-center rounded bg-base-200">
      {{ testVue }}
    </p>
  </div>
</template>
```

import SolidInVue from "@/components/blog/using-vue/SolidInVue.vue";

<SolidInVue client:visible />

## Wait, both numbers are in sync!

If you noticed that both components in Vue and Solid are in sync,
100 points to you! Yes, they are in sync because I made them in sync.

Ihis is how I glued both Solid and Vue together,
which I know, looks sacrilegious.

```ts
export const [test, setTest] = createSignal(0);
export const testVue = ref(0);
export function increment() {
  testVue.value++;
}
watch(
  () => testVue.value,
  (val) => {
    setTest(val);
  },
);
```

`createEffect` is frowned upon in Solid because it will never be disposed.
But in this case, Vue doesn't warn anything about `watch`. (I'm not sure. It might
leak memory as I speak but it doesn't warn.)

Just like how you can `store.subscribe` in Svelte stores outside of Svelte components!

## Doing it legally.

If you feel that what we did was illegal, you can use [`createGlobalState`](https://vueuse.org/shared/createGlobalState/#without-persistence-store-in-memory)
from `@vueuse/core` to create a global state.

```ts
import { createGlobalState } from "@vueuse/core";
import { ref } from "vue";

export const useWords = createGlobalState(() => {
  const words = ref([]);
  return { words };
});
```

Or you can also swap out `ref` with `useLocalStorage` from `@vueuse/core` to persist the state.

## Conclusion

Vue is a very flexible framework that allows you to do a lot of things.

- Creating reactive objects outside of Vue components
- Watching the reactive objects outside of Vue components â†’ which means you can
  even do it under `<script>` tags in Astro component!
- Many helpers in `@vueuse/core` to make your life easier

And this allows you to do a lot of things that you can't do in other frameworks,
especially when you want to share states between islands in Astro.
